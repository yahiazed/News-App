  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  assets:
    - assets/lang/en.json
    - assets/lang/ar.json
    - assets/images/x.png
  fonts:
    - family: jannah
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/jannah.ttf
    - family: ubuntu
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu.regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu.light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu.bold.ttf

    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    - family: IconBroken
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/icons.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
